**_Changing the player or changing the game?_** We want to explore the tension between individuals and society with you. 
Which actors have to take responsibility for what in order to comply with the Paris agreement? 
How much actual change is contained in political and technological narratives and where are the blind spots? 
On the weekend from **05.11.21** to **07.11.21** we want to contribute an active part to the public debate around this topic. 
Therefore, we want to work with you to create output. 
The goal is that you, in your team, have formulated your thoughts and ideas into something tangible at the end of the weekend. 
Whatever output format you choose depends on you! 
We suggest a range of formats and provide supporting resources for each. 
These will help your development and give you an idea of what is possible. 
The potential output formats include:

- **Written text**, which could be an article or blog post, for example
- **Code**, which could be an interactive model, an API, a database, or a piece of software
- **Legislative Output**, this includes contributions such as petitions,
  Draft legislation or position statements on legislation
- **Community Project**, you have an idea on how to mobilize large groups of people? Then go for it!
- **Art-Project**

We know that teh aforementioned output formats can take up much more time than a single weekend. 
The goal is therefore not perfection, but a reasonably draft of the idea and a potential plan to go forwards. 
We wish to enable you the possibility to pursue your ideas, or for others to do so as well.
In this way, we hope to foster a sustainable discourse.

## Presenters and mentors

You will be supported by mentors and speakers who will guide you through the chosen format and provide input, ideas, and feedback.
You can look forward to some exciting presentations. In addition, we are sure that you will be able to create something fantastic with the help of the mentors.
