We are a young and motivated team with the goal of promoting an interdisciplinary exchange on sustainability in society. 
Our backgrounds are different disciplines and we are united by the idea of being able to generate change together.
We organize interdisciplinary events with exciting content, which, in addition to education, also enable spaces for new initiatives and projects as well as for
networking. 
Thereby, together we can become multipliers of sustainable change.

_We are looking forward to meeting you!_
