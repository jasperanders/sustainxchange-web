title: "SUSTAIN X EVENT"
---

Global crises like climate change, species extinction or the COVID-19 pandemic
can only be solved collectively. 
We have the goal to promote exchange about about sustainability in society and to raise sustainability higher on the agenda.
However, this exchange should not only be about sustainability, it should also be sustainable itself. 
The concepts and ideas we generate should not only remain in our heads, but also find their ways into public spaces, businesses, and politics.
That is why we work in a results-oriented manner on any topic, i.e. we contribute to the discourse with concrete actions.
We organize conferences and other interactive events, where you can become active yourself. Curious?

Take a look and join us!
