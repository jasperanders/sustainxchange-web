abstract:
  "Approaches to solving sustainability problems require a specific
  problem-solving mode, encompassing the complexity, fuzziness and
  interdisciplinary nature of the problem. This paper aims to promote a complex
  systemsâ€™ view of addressing sustainability problems, in particular through the
  tool of network science, and provides an outline of an interdisciplinary
  training workshop."
